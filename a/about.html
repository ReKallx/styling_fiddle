        <h4 class="entity-container-subhead">The K is for Kevin</h4>
        <p class="container-p">The idea of ReKall came to being after an unfortunate accident that happened to our good friend and team member, Kevin Cutler. Kevin had a blood vessel in his brain suddenly burst, leaving him in an incapacitated state that created a crisis for his friends and family. Adding to the hardship of the emergency, he recently moved to Dallas from Oklahoma. The lack of information about his life here in Dallas made the situation ever more difficult. This left family and friends with plenty of questions and zero answers. No one knew how to contact his work, access his apartment, what bills needed to be handled, or anything. Experiencing this first hand and the frustrations and agony of seeking out information to help Kevin in his situation while he lay in a coma prompted our team to set out and fix this problem. After many months and hard work, Kevin made a full recovery and is an important part of the ReKall team. We are extremely proud of Kevin and excited to bring you ReKall!</p>

        <h3 class="entity-container-title">What We Are</h3>
        <p class="container-p">Do you ever wonder if your closest friends and family would know what to do in the event that something would ever happen to you? Who would they contact? Do you have any pets needing care? Who would contact your boss? Insurance information? The list goes on.<br /><br />ReKall was created to provide your family and friends with answers in the event of an emergency where something happens to you. Rather than leave your friends and family clueless and scrambling for answers in your absesnse, why not leave them with some direction?
